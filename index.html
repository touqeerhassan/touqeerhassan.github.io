                  <p>Touqeer is very professional and a highly skilled software engineer, when I started working with
                    him, our app was messed up and there were so many errors and bugs. He took responsibility and in a
                    very short time, resolved any bugs and issues that we had. Also his communication was excellent, he
                    would always reach out to me for meetings when required and would clear all the doubts for a smooth
                    development and delivery.

                  <p>I came to know that Touqeer is a cloud guy as well. I asked him to move the whole architecture on
                    AWS and also do video hosting on AWS, he did that very smoothly and our app in now on AWS
                    architecture. Our video streaming is now better than before and it works greatly. Thanks Touqeer!

                    Touqeer is a knowledgeable and persistent problem solver. Very punctual and communicative. Helped me
                    fix a bug with Yarn install not working on remote Ubuntu server. My project uses Yarn Workspaces and
                    could not use NPM as an alternative. Touqeer also coached me through configuring my firewall on the
                    remote server, and explained why pm2 is needed to keep a Node app running after you close your ssh
                    connection. Thank you for the help understanding the deployment process of a React and Node app on
                    an Ubuntu VPS
